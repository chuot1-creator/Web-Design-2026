	 <p>My name is Caleigh and I am a junior here at CC pursuing a degree in Marketing with minors in Management and Graphic Design. I am also a member of the track and field team on campus, work for the Business School as a Social Media Marketing Intern, and am the Vice President of the American Marketing Assocation club. </p>
	<p>In my free time I like to hangout with friends, exercise, spend time outdoors, read, watch TV, and do any type of arts and crafts. I don't have any experience in Web Design, so I am very excited to learn about the topic!</p>
	<p class="joke">How do bees get to school? On the school buzz!</p>
